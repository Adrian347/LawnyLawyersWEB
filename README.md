# LawnyLawyersWEB

Lawny Lawyers is a web application that consumes a RESTful web service. The service
makes use of basic CRUD operations and JPA repositories to manage employee (Lawyer) and
product (Art) entities. Cardinality between entities is such that employees maintain 
a one-to-many relationship with their products.

Employees and products have been bootstrapped in to the application; to view, select
View from the navigation bar. Products can also be edited or deleted from the repository
 from here. To add a new employee or product to the repository, select Add. 
 
This application also demonstrates some styling using HTML/CSS.
